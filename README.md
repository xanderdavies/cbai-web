We think that preventing catastrophic accidents from advanced AI systems is one of the most important and interesting problems of our time <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565">[1]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13353">[2]</a>. We also think that there are open opportunities for many more researchers to make progress on it, and that technical undergraduate and graduate students are particularly well suited to begin careers in AI safety. CBAI supports and accelerates students interested in pursuing careers in AI safety. We are currently hiring; please contact us at <a href="mailto:hiring@cbai.ai">hiring@cbai.ai</a> to express interest.
